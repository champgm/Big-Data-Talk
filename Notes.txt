Notes

Story
-Few months ago
-End of iteration
-Nathan (sub-team's manager) out of town
-Everyone pick own JIRAs
-Cache CSV files in HDFS 
--Process them with crunch
--CVX

CSV Is Weird
-4 records in list
-3rd record has a bulleted list in one of its fields
-WEIRD
--CSV doesn't have to be "C"SV
--Optional header rows
--Any field in any file can be surrouneded by quotes, inside of which all sorts of weird things can take place, such as NEWLINES
--Hadoop/crunch input formats are simple

Hadoop
-flow diagram, first three things, format, splits, record reader
-Input format
--split data
--create record reader
--(explain how csv record reader works)
---Jump ahead 1 split
---check if in record, mark for split
-Record reader
--parse split into records
---Opens file, seeks to split
---uses utility to parse record-by-record

Input Format Summary
-This is cool, but not easily configurable
-Configuration requires setting config values in hadoop job configuration

Using Crunch
-Crunch takes care of configuration in a sane way
-Take input parameters, set config, and use input format later

Building Crunch
-Start with Input Format
-Add CSVFileSource 
--Takes configuration options
--Sets them
--Uses its defined InputFormat to read the files
-Add wrapper classes "Readable data" and "file reader factory"
--Both wrappers for an iterator over the file

Summary
-File source
--Mark input format for use
--configures input format
-Input Format
--splits input file
--configures record reader
--iterates through a split's records
